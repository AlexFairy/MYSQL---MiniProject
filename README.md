# MYSQL---MiniProject

This miniproject for MYSQL is a data science project, essentially speaking. It can be accessed two ways: (1) MySQL WorkBench (2) Using an IDE and making sue Python is installed.
It does require a connector and a password. So, you have to use YOUR OWN PASSWORD.
The purpose of this data science application is to CREATE YOUR OWN LIBRARY from home.
Futhermore, this program does make good practice for creating similar codes (just study the code and replicate it).

NOTE:
There are lots of my personal notes on the file, because it helps me understand the code when I return to it.
